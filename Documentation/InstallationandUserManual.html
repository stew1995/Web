  <h2>Installation Manual</h2>
    <p>The product in this final state has been tested on Chrome and Firefox and
      all functionality works when being on these browsers. However little testing
      has been done on Internet Explorer with some functionality working well with
      other parts not working at all. There is no installation required for the social
      media site however installation of PHP and MySQL was needed on the server database
      and tables are created automatically by AJAX and no need for manual installation
      making everything work on first load, however if this doesn’t happen go to
      lib/database.php and lib/data.php to run the database and tables inside it.</p>
    <p>For the product to be run locally the source code can be cloned from github
      and then run as long as the server has PHP and MySQL installed.
      To get the code and run locally copy the URL of the product from git and
      type in to the terminal git clone (then the URL), this will pull all the
      source code from the website also allowing the user to develop the product more. </p>

    <p>Profile pictures uploaded are saved in a folder in lib with the same thing
      happens when the user creates notes, but in the relevant folder, so this is
      where these files can be found. Anything to do with the search bar is located
      in a separate folder so that it doesn’t get mixed up with other files in the
      directories</p>

    <h2>User Manual</h2>
    <p>The users first time to the website they will be required to create an account
      with their basic information such as their name, email, password and which hobbies
       and societies new students want to join or what current students are part of.
       It is then required that the user inputs information about their university degree
        to ensure that they are students. The user has a personal calendar that can be
         used to see dates of upcoming events and assignments. The searching feature
         searches for users as well as the option to search halls of residence and
         societies in the advanced search section with other options available.</p>
